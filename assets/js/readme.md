### Alameda
AMD builds of Bower/NPM in the wild are at different levels of brokenness.

In order to provide automatic support for more of them Alameda build included here is patched. Patched version can be found in [this fork](https://github.com/nazar-pc/alameda/tree/package-with-named-define), [upstream PR](https://github.com/requirejs/alameda/pull/23) was rejected with fair statement that those broken packages should be fixed, but we want to support them while they are not fixed, visit related [upstream issue](https://github.com/requirejs/alameda/issues/22) for discussion.
